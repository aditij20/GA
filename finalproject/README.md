Data Science Final Project
--

Real-time and historical machine learning from twitter data and visualization:
 - Which tweets are insults and in which categories do they fall (e.g. sports,politics...)
 - Let's map using a sensible data normalization 


1) Data - raw geocoded JSON Twitter dump of 1% live stream
    - parsed output containing appropriate fields
    - spatially aggregated twitter data (by FIPS county code)

2) web - D3.js visualization. This needs a lot of work. 

3) v1 - First version of code. Mostly Python code along with Pig scripts for Amazon EMR
